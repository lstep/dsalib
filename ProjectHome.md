dsalib is a module for Python that retrieves all the details for each Debian alert published on Debian's security website (http://security.debian.org), parses it, and put it in an exploitable/queryable way.

If you're interested in this module, you may be interested in the application that uses this module, named dsacheck, available on Google Code too.

Please note that this module uses decorators, so you'll need at least Python 2.4.
